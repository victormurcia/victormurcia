# Hey everyone, I'm Victor!
I'm interested in data, science, and programming in all its forms and flavors. I'm particularly passionate about using science and data in a positively actionable way. I mostly code in Python and IGOR, but I've done projects where I utilized FORTRAN, JS, C++, and MATLAB.

I recommend you check out the following repositories:
1) DFT Clustering - This is one of the main products of my doctoral research. Check out how it is possible to combine the results of first principle (Quantum Mechanics/Density Functional Theory) calculations with experimental synchrotron-based x-ray measurements using machine learning (ML) techniques to get optical and orientational information for molecules of interest in fields like organic electronics and pharmaceuticals. 

2) Making Music From Images - Check out this project I did where I used Python to make songs from pictures! I made an app with Streamlit that you can try out with your own pictures. You can control things like the scale, base note, number of octaves, note duration, the number of pixels to use for the song as well a wide variety of after effects to give your song an even more unique character. It was combined at one point with Stable Diffusion models for Generative AI to create one of the first instances of AI generated music.

I graduated with a PhD in Materials Science and Engineering especializing in Computational Physics/Chemistry and Machine Learning/Algorithm Development from Washington State University in August 2022. You can find my dissertation here: https://www.proquest.com/docview/2731807103?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true. 

I also have a B.S. in Chemistry with minors in Mathematics and Philosophy from the Rochester Institute of Technology that I earned in May 2014. 

I currently work as a Data Scientist at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs within the National Artifical Intelligence Institute (NAII) and the Massachusetts Veterans Epidemiology Research and Information Center (MAVERIC)

I hope you find some of my repos useful and/or interesting! Connect with me on Twitter or LinkedIn
